    "The Bollinger Bands indictors is a kind of volatility indictor which uses the moving average over a portion of days and finds a certain standard deviation above and below that moving average. This indictor relies on the theory of mean reversion where asset prices, after spikes in price changes, revert towards the moving average of price. This indictor also shows how volatile an asset is; if the bands are farther apart, then more volatile the asset is. Traders may use this strategy by buying an asset when the price reaches the lower standard deviation and then sell at the higher standard deviation. Usually, traders use 2 standard deviations away from the mean and have a moving average window of 20 periods."
